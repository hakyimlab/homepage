[In this report] (https://s3.amazonaws.com/imlab-open/Webdata/Files/2018/qqplot-calibration.pdf) I calculate the lower bounds of p-values when using very rare variants, for which minor allele counts are in the single digits.
This report was prepared back in 2012 for the T2D-GENES consortium that had just generated 10K whole exome sequenced data.
