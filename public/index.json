[{"content":"Other projects Genomic Privacy Genomic privacy and data sharing are issues of relevance for the whole scientific community. Protecting the privacy of individuals who participate in a study has always been a top priority and it has been widely assumed that publishing summary results did not jeopardize privacy. In 2008, Homer et al found that in the case of genome wide association studies (GWAS), summary results such as allele frequencies for a large number of genetic variants can reveal whether a person participated in a study and the disease status of the individual. These results forced the NIH to withdraw most of the public access to GWAS study results. We were interested in sharing results from quantitative traits such as gene expression phenotypes, which provide critical information on the regulatory role of genetic variants. The question here was whether publishing regression coefficients from GWAS would also allow re-identification. Dr. Im proved mathematically that re-identification based on regression coefficients was possible, provided an explicit method and computed its theoretical power as a function of sample size, number of markers, and false positive rate. In fact, She found that even the sign of the regression coefficients was enough to reveal a person’s participation. This is exemplary publication #1, which was published in American Journal of Human Genetics (Im et al, 2012). Given its wide public relevance, this paper was featured on the University of Chicago Hospitals Science blog - click here and has been routinely cited by papers on genomic privacy.\nPoly-Omic Prediction of Complex Traits. Prediction of disease risk or treatment response is one of the pillars of personalized medicine. Although genome-wide association studies have discovered thousands of well-replicated polymorphisms associated with a broad spectrum of complex traits, the combined predictive power of these associations for any given trait is generally too low to be of clinical relevance. To address these issues, We proposed a systems approach to complex trait prediction, which leverages and integrates similarity in genetic and other high throughput molecular traits (omic data). The approach translates the omic similarity into phenotypic similarity using a method called Kriging, commonly used in Geostatistics. My method called OmicKriging emphasizes the use of a wide variety of systems-level data, such as those increasingly made available by comprehensive surveys of the genome, transcriptome and epigenome, for complex trait prediction. Application to clinical and cellular phenotypes shows the advantages of integrating multiple omic data in a collective manner. This was published in Genetic Epidemiology (Wheeler et al 2014). This paper has been chosen for the Robert C. Elston Best Paper Award by the International Genetic Epidemiology Society (IGES) to be awarded at the IGES meeting in October 2015.\n","title":"Published Research","uri":"/project/other-projects/"},{"content":"Published research PrediXcan, a regulatory mechanism driven gene discovery tool Although investments in genomic studies of complex diseases made possible the discovery of thousands of variants robustly associated with these traits, the translation of these discoveries into actionable targets has been hampered by the lack of a mechanistic understanding on how genome variation relates to phenotype. Moreover, it has been widely shown that a substantial portion of the genetic control of complex traits is exerted through the regulation of gene expression traits, but effective methods to fully harness this mechanism were not available. To address these challenges, we developed a gene-based test —PrediXcan— that directly tests this regulatory mechanism and substantially improves power relative to single variant tests and other gene-based tests. PrediXcan is inherently mechanistic and provides directionality, highlighting its potential utility in identifying novel targets for therapy. PrediXcan was the first of the class of methods known currently as TWAS (transcriptome-wide association studies). More details can be found in this paper. The following figure shows a schematic description of the method.\n        PrediXcan tests the mediating effect of a target gene on disease risk. The left panel shows the components of the expression of a gene. PrediXcan tests the association between the genetically regulated component and the complex trait and is not affected by the reverse effects of the disease on the expression. The mechanistic model behind PrediXcan is shown on the right panel. The genetic profile of an individual determines a baseline gene expression level (genetically determined expression), which is further modified by environment and other factors. For deleterious causal genes this final level determines the liability to disease which can lead to disease if it surpasses certain threshold.    Scaling up PrediXcan to integrate large-scale data Genetic studies have discovered many thousands of locations on chromosomes that are associated with health or disease, but the majority of these fall outside of protein-encoding regions, and so it is difficult to understand just how they exert their influences. PrediXcan leverages large scale DNA, observable trait, and gene expression datasets, as well as machine learning, to infer from these discoveries which genes are actually influenced and whether an up or downregulation of the gene is beneficial. Despite the appeal and success of this approach, which directly identifies candidate drug targets, accumulating experience revealed that data from over a million individuals would be required in many cases. We therefore developed an approach that bypasses the need to use individual level data and takes advantage of summary results, to vastly expand the applicability and power of the original PrediXcan method. The new approach, called S-PrediXcan, allows to find potential target genes for modulating thousands of traits across a broad set of human tissues. These results are now publicly available and have gathered users across the globe and led to funded collaborations. Most of the associations proved to be tissue-specific, suggesting context specificity of the trait etiology. Significant associations in unexpected tissues also underscored the need for an agnostic scanning of multiple contexts to improve the ability to detect causal regulatory mechanisms. Monogenic disease genes were enriched among significant associations for related traits, suggesting that smaller alterations of these genes may cause a spectrum of milder phenotypes. More details can be found in this paper\nGenetic architecture of expression traits across tissues We investigated the genetic architecture of gene expression traits, which are important intermediate processes to understand the mechanisms by which genetic variation affect complex diseases and traits. We found that in contrast to the polygenic nature of complex diseases, most of the variation of gene expression traits is driven by a small number of variants (eQTLs). In addition to providing insight into the biology of the transcriptome, this finding has practical implications for the best approaches to predict gene expression traits. More details can be found in this paper\nBoosting the power to identify target genes by exploiting the tissue sharing of gene expression regulation An unexpected finding from the GTEx consortium (large scale transcriptome study of 900 organ donors with whole body tissue sampled across 49 tissues) was the widespread sharing of genetic regulation of expression traits across tissues. We estimated that more than half of the eQTLs (variants associated with expression levels) are active across all tissues. One implication of this is that eQTL-based studies will have little specificity to narrow down the tissue where disease initiates. However, one can take advantage of this lack of specificity and consider the different tissue panels as independent experiments and aggregate the information across all of them. We developed MultiXcan to implement this idea and show its effectiveness. More details can be found in this paper\nApplication to childhood and adult onset asthma data in the UK Biobank Regardless of how sophisticated they may be, analytical methods only matter if they can answer relevant scientific questions. We teamed up with Carole Ober and Dan Nicolae, experts in asthma genetics, to examine the shared and distinct genetic factors of childhood and adult onset asthma risk applying state of the art methods implemented in our lab’s analytical pipeline. For the first time, data on age of onset of asthma became available through the UK Biobank for a sufficiently large number of individuals. We seized the opportunity to identify novel genetic factors that are specific to childhood onset cases as well as those shared with adult onset cases. We found that genetic factors of adult onset asthma are a subset of childhood onset asthma with overall smaller effects suggesting a larger environmental component in adult cases. Tissue enrichment analysis suggested the role of allergy and epithelial barrier disfunction in childhood onset asthma and lung involvement in adult onset asthma. Both types shared immune components.

However there are several aspects that can be improved to increase detection and reduce false discoveries. A substantial portion of my effort will be devoted to developing methods to achieve this goal.\nReducing spurious results due to LD contamination Linkage disequilibrium (LD, correlation of genetic variation within proximal genomic regions) can lead to associated genes and phenotypes even when the underlying causal variants are distinct. This is a difficult problem given the widespread LD in the population. We are examining several approaches to mitigate this problem. One is by using fine-mapping methods, which seeks to increase the resolution of the association and narrow down the causal variant to a single variant. Another one is to use orthogonal approaches that seek to cancel out the confounding by averaging across multiple independent genes.\nMethods to quantify mediating role of molecular traits that are robust to LD contamination The goal is to quantify the proportion of phenotypic variability that can be explained by the regulation of transcript levels or other molecular intermediate phenotypes. We call this concept regulability in analogy to the heritability concept. This quantity can be tissue dependent. Characterizing the relative importance of different tissues and brain regions will provide insight into the etiology of complex diseases. Moreover, this method can be applied to quantify the contribution of a gene set or pathway, which provides not only significance but also magnitude of the effect.\nOpen sharing of software, methods, and public databases of resources and results Users across the globe are using PrediXcan and related methods and resources. We will continue hosting the resources and providing support to users.\nBuild a catalog of the function of every human gene (PhenomeXcan) One of the important feature of PrediXcan is the ability to identify target genes. My team and We will apply state of the art methods from my lab to large scale data from UK Biobank and other public repositories such as dbGaP to build a catalog of the function of every human gene.\nExtend PrediXcan to imaging (ImageXcan) Environmental perturbations have a large impact in phenotypes both in concert and independently of genetic factors. We will investigate the effect of environment and its interaction with genetic factors on complex phenotypes. Large scale biobanks, such as UK Biobank and the recently started All of Us, offer an unprecedented opportunity to study gene-environment interaction with high dimensional data on millions of individuals. We will start to extending the ideas of PrediXcan from the transcriptome to the “radiome”, the high dimensional data available in MRIs and other images of the human body. We expect this line of research to provide important insights into the gene and gene-environment contribution to complex diseases. It will be a focus of my R01 application anticipated to be submitted in October 2019.\nMulti-ethnic and multi-omic extension of PrediXcan Until recently, large reference transcriptome datasets were composed of individuals of mostly European descent. In response to the need of multi-ethnic representation, The NHLBI Trans-omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) Program has selected samples from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) for the pilot phase of trans-omic data generation. This provides the opportunity to address the limitations of PrediXcan by training prediction models in multiple ethnic backgrounds. Therefore, We propose here to adapt my prediction pipelines for the multi-ethnic RNA-seq, methylomic, and proteomic data from MESA. These prediction models will allow propagation of molecular information from the subset of assayed individuals to the much larger set for which only genetic data are available. Leveraging these higher quality models, We anticipate achieving improved functional data interpretation and multi-ethnic performance.\n","title":"Ongoing Research","uri":"/project/ongoing-research/"},{"content":"Publications Find the full list of our publications courtesy of Google Scholar following this link here\n","title":"Publications","uri":"/card/publication/"},{"content":"  Rodrigo Bonazzola, MS - Currently PhD Student at the University of Leeds Github\n  Jiamao Zheng, PhD - Bio\n  Scott Dickinson, MS - Bio\n  Padma Sheila Rajagopal, MD - Bio\n  Josh Jiang (Zhuoxun) - Bio\n  Bayle Smith-Salzberg - Bio\n  Owen Melia - Bio\n  Alvaro Barbeira, MS - Bio\n  Milton Pividori, PhD - Bio - ORCID\n  ","title":"Alumni","uri":"/card/alumni/"},{"content":"Contact Email haky at uchicago dot edu\n@hakyim\n","title":"","uri":"/card/contact/"},{"content":"Genomic Data Scientist / Scientific Programmer Position We are looking to hire a life-long learner interested in developing statistical and computational tools to sift through large amounts of data with the ultimate goal of making discoveries that can make a difference in the health of people.

We have overhauled the model construction, incorporating posterior inclusion probabilities and global patterns of tissue sharing, while also benefiting from larger sample sizes.

However, these models require additional GWAS preprocessing in some public GWAS studies, which we describe here.\nWe are happy to announce the user-friendly tutorial and detailed documentation.\nOur new recommended models use fine-mapped variants (as computed by DAP-G).

These new models are parsimonious, efficient, available for more genes, and have many benefits like improved rate of colocalized associations.\nHowever, the fine-mapped variants are often missing in older GWAS, lack an rsid, and GTEx v8 is defined on hg38 genome assembly. So, additional GWAS preprocessing may be required to fully exploit the new models. As most current GWAS are defined on older genome assemblies like hg19 or hg18, “harmonizing” variants between assemblies is required. Additionally, a particular GWAS' genotyping platform and imputation techniques might have poor intersection with GTEx v8 variants, so that imputation of missing variants is recommended.

Download from here. We have updated our processing pipeline, and restricted to individuals of European ancestry to obtain more reliable LD data. This reduces false positive associations in the Summary Version of PrediXcan. Because of this choice, the gain in sample size relative to V6p is modest (ranging from -18 to 89), with whole blood, LCLs and fibroblasts experiencing reduced sample size. We developed new criteria to assess model performance. We have also decided to include prediction models for both pseudogenes and lincRNAs. While preparing GTEx V7 prediction models, we identified a few issues in the way prediction performance was estimated in the previous release (2016-09-08 release). In aggregate, these caused the prediction model performance to be overestimated. Reassuringly, predicted expression levels and the downstream associations with phenotypes remain mostly unchanged, even though prediction weights vary slightly. However, some gene/tissue pairs are no longer considered reliable (link to list). Detailed description of the pipeline update and the effect in prediction models performance and downstream S-PrediXcan association can be found below. Comparison between V7 and V6p, new and old pipeline Here we compare prediction models based on GTEx V6p (2016-09-08) and V7. While training the V7 models we identified a few issues in the V6 pipeline used for the September and November 2016 release. We identified 3 issues in the V6p pipeline used in the release of September 2016. We describe here the issues, the consequences in prediction performance estimates and downstream S-PrediXcan association, and the fixes. Issue 1: Penalization parameter was estimated in-sample (using all the samples) V6p old pipeline computed R2 using lambda estimated from all data. This led to overestimates of the performance measures. See Figure 1. We classified gene/tissue pairs with negative correlation in the red group (to be dropped). This proportion ranges from 6 to 13%, with larger proportions for tissues with smaller sample sizes. If a more conservative cutoff of 0.10 is used, 22% to 29% of genes would be dropped. Issue 2: There was induced negative correlation between training and test sets This was causing a slight underestimation of performance. In the old pipeline, the correlation between predicted and actual was computed using all folds combined. The sample mean of the training set (which excludes the test fold) is necessarily of opposite sign to the sample mean of the fold (all data mean was 0, so that the test fold average is of opposite sign to the training set’s average). This effect leads to a small underestimation of the correlation. Figure 2 shows the correlation estimated within each fold and averaged across folds, which is slightly larger than the correlation from the old pipeline. Issue 3: Sign of correlation (predicted vs actual) was ignored There were a few genes that had negative correlation between predicted and actual but the old pipeline was accepting them as reliable model because it was only considering the square and the p-value of the correlation. Consequence in prediction performance measures The combined consequence of the three bugs can be seen in Figure 1 where the correlation between predicted and actual (with in sample lambda for the old pipeline and out of sample lambda for the new pipeline) is shown. This error did not affect well predicted genes (upper right region of the plot). The lower left region shows that the old pipeline was over estimating the correlation (most points to the left of the identity line). Fig 1: Estimated correlation between predicted and observed expression levels. The old pipeline overestimated (y axis) the correlation between predicted and actual expression levels (x axis). The effect is more notable for at the lower end of correlations. Figure 2 shows the old pipeline estimates on the y axis, and on the x-axis is the correlation using the in-sample (all data) lambda parameter but computing the correlation within each fold and averaging across folds. Therefore, Figure 2 is showing the effects of bugs 2 and 3. There are more points to the left of the identity line, indicating that bug 2 was underestimating the performance. ￼ Fig 2: (in-sample lambda) cross validated correlation between predicted and actual expression level. The corrected pipeline’s correlation estimates tend to be larger (more points below the identity line) than the old pipeline’s estimates. Definition of color coding by reliability Red: gene/tissue pairs for which the correlation between predicted and actual expression (nested cross validation) levels were negative with the new pipeline with nested cross validation (all parameters including the penalization parameter lambda is computed without using the data to be predicted). Green: gene/tissue pairs that pass the new more stringent performance criterion (nested cross validated correlation  0.10, pvalue0.9) Yellow: remaining gene/tissue pairs. Consequences in S-PrediXcan results Generally speaking, S-PrediXcan Z-scores remain mostly around the identity line. Figure 3 shows V7 vs V6 PrediXcan Z-scores for the height phenotype from the GIANT consortium. We also examined similar figures for over 40 phenotypes and found that Genes in common yield similar predixcan Z-scores Genes in V7 and not in V6p tend to be slightly more significant than genes in V6p and not in V7. Figure 3: Comparison of S-PrediXcan Z-score using V7 (y-axis) vs V6p (old pipeline). Most gene tissue pairs cluster around the identity line. Points strictly in horizontal axis and vertical axis correspond to gene/tissue pairs that were missing in the other version.

That said, given that PrediXcan is seeking to test the role of gene expression variation on traits and we and others have shown that significant PrediXcan genes are enriched in causal genes, these results should be useful to delve into the mechanisms underlying gene to phenotype associations. False positives can arise because of several factors LD contamination By computing the probability of LD contamination, we try to reduce false positives due to LD rather than genuine colocalization of trait and expression causal variants. Filtering out genes with high probability of independent signals (P30.5) would reduce the number of hits due to LD contamination. Co regulation Many loci show regulation of multiple genes. PrediXcan is not able to distinguish between truly causal and co-regulation but non causal genes. Mismatched LD between study, reference, and training sets Misspecified LD can lead to false positives (for example if LD in the study population is much higher than in the reference population, highly correlated modestly significant SNPs may be considered to be independent evidence of association, leading to highly significant gene-level association). They are also needed for combining results across multiple tissues, or to run conditional analysis. ","title":"Limitations of PrediXcan association results","uri":"/post/2017/11/07/limitations-of-predixcan-association-results/"},{"content":"PrediXcan and other transcriptome wide association study (TWAS) methods discover and prioritize genes based on a functional mechanism –regulation of gene expression. We agree that we have to temper over-enthusiasm, but Wainberg et al’s paper could represent a backlash to the enthusiasm that the community has for this approach, which we believe is well placed.\nBelow are our responses to some of the statements of the paper.\n PrediXcan/TWAS associations do not imply causality\n Yes, we have explicitly stated that we do not claim causality but agree that the message needs to be emphasized. However, the over-interpretation of TWAS results as causal (which itself seems overstated by Wainberg et al), is precisely because of the exciting aspect of TWAS as association testing ‘through a lens’ of a particular functional mechanism that we believe is very important, namely, regulation of gene expression.\n TWAS is vulnerable to find multiple associated genes because of co-regulation\n Yes, when a GWAS lead SNP is associated with the expression of several local co-regulated genes, TWAS will yield multiple associated genes. No one would argue that a TWAS result implicating multiple local genes should be interpreted as meaning that all of those genes are likely to be contributing to the trait. But assuming that a single gene is always at the root of a GWAS or TWAS signal also seems unnecessarily restrictive. Molecular biology and model organism genetics would suggest that allelic heterogeneity should be the norm. Although admittedly we don’t see huge evidence for it in complex trait GWAS, we do see it in eQTL data and arguably this is a reason why TWAS discovers new genes.\nA different source of false positive associations (not considered by Wainberg et al) is LD contamination. This phenomenon occurs, for example, when a variant alters expression of a gene but a different variant is causing changes in the phenotype but both variants are in LD. Unlike the coregulation confounding, which can only be teased out via wet lab experiments, LD contamination may be quantified and corrected. As for GWAS loci, fine mapping and conditional analysis may be used to addressed this issue.\n “TWAS exhibits instability when tissue/expression panel is changed”\n The expectation that an association found in one tissue should also be found in another one seems to be the problem. A better way to describe these results is that when a gene exhibits tissue-specific genetic regulation, we cannot be surprised to see tissue-specific phenotype associations. This is, we would argue, a feature not a bug.\nWhen the regulatory mechanism is highly context specific, it is possible and likely that none of the reference transcriptome dataset has captured it. This is not a limitation of the approach, but rather of the data available for investigation. We cannot build predictive models without training data, and genes expressed in a single cell type that is poorly represented in available tissues will not be well interrogated with the method, which has been widely acknowledged in the original publications as a limitation of the method.\n “False positive rate is high but unquantifiable”\n Would Wainberg et al. consider traditional GWAS to have a high false positive rate due to the large number of associations attributable to LD?\n TWAS is simply a weighted burden test\n We agree that it is a weighted burden test analytically, but of course the weights have meaning, and that is the effect of the variants on gene expression. Therefore, this weighted burden test is exactly what it purports to be: an association test of a trait with genetically regulated expression.\nThis post is the results of discussions among (in alphabetic order) Nancy Cox, Eric Gamazon, Laura Huckins, Hae Kyung Im, Douglas Ruderfer, Pamela Sklar, and Eli Stahl.\n","title":"Vulnerabilities of the 'Vulnerabilities of transcriptome wide association studies' argument","uri":"/post/2017/11/07/vulnerabilities-of-the-vulnerabilities-of-transcriptome-wide-association-studies-argument/"},{"content":"Most GWAS and eQTL studies have been performed in European samples.

This theme itself is completely plain-text and lightweight, and does not use any icons, images, or emojis.1 By default, the theme only uses two JavaScript libraries, MathJax and highlight.js, and they are loaded only when necessary. The rest of JavaScript is written from scratch and also relatively short. This theme does not use any CSS frameworks, and the full CSS code is also written from scratch (about 300 lines). It is not the man who has too little that is poor, but the one who hankers after more. — Letters from a Stoic This page introduces the features of this Hugo theme that you can fiddle with. Site configurations Below are the possible options that you may configure for a site based on this theme. Menus Each page has a menu in the header and a menu in the footer. The header menu is defined in the header option in menu in config.yaml, and similarly, the footer menu is defined in the footer option, e.g., menu: header: - name: Home url: \"/\" weight: 1 - name: About url: \"/about/\" weight: 2 footer: - name: Contact url: \"/404.html\" weight: 1 - name: Categories url: \"/categories/\" weight: 2 pre: \"optional\" The url of a menu item can be either a relative URL pointing to a page on this website, or an external link (e.g., url: \"https://github.com/yihui\"). The order of the menu items is determined by the weight values. If a menu item has a pre value, it will be used as the class of the menu item. The special value optional indicates that this menu item will be hidden on small screens.2 The header menu can be made sticky via the parameter pageFeatures in config.yaml: params: pageFeatuers: [+sticky_menu] This feature can be disabled per-page if enabled globally in config.yaml—-add -sticky_menu to the features YAML field in the single page, e.g., features: [-sticky_menu] Home page The body of the home page consists of an introduction, followed by a series of info cards, and then a number of the latest posts and pages. The introduction comes from content/_index.md. The Markdown content can contain arbitrary elements. The info cards come from the content/card/ directory. Each (Markdown) file is displayed on the home page as a separate card. The title is displayed vertically on the left or right side.3 If you want to customize the style of a certain card, you may use the YAML option style in the file, e.g., --- title: \"Courses\" style: \"background: darkorange; color: white;\" --- This will add a dark orange background to the card, and change the color of text to white. You can use any CSS styles here (e.g., font-size, background-image, and padding). The number of latest posts and pages can be defined via the homePosts option in params in config.yaml, e.g., params: homePosts: 10 The default is 6. The mainSections parameter can be used to select the sections of pages to be included on the home page, e.g., params: mainSections: [\"post\", \"news\"] Footer Besides the menu in the footer, you can specify a copyright statement in the footer parameter in config.yaml, e.g., params: footer: \"\u0026copy; Frida Gomam 2015 -- 2020\" Comments Disqus, Utterances Searching This theme supports searching out of the box based on Fuse.js. A few critical configurations: The site needs to generate a JSON index. This is done via a layout file index.json.json in layouts/_default/, and the config in config.yaml: outputs: home: [html, rss, json] A menu item with the ID menu-search configured in config.yaml, e.g., menu: header: - name: Search url: \"#\" identifier: menu-search The version of Fuse can be configured via the parameter fuseVersion in config.yaml, e.g., params: fuseVersion: 6.4.3 If no fuseVersion is specified, the latest version of Fuse.js will be used. You may also download a copy of Fuse.js to the static/ folder of your site and use this copy instead of loading it from CDN. To do that, you may download Fuse.js to, say, static/js/fuse.js and modify the partial template layouts/partials/foot_custom.html. Replace {{ with .Site.Params.fuseVersion }}  {{ end }} with  That way, you can also use search when viewing the site offline, because Fuse.js is no longer loaded from CDN. Articles At the moment, I’m too tired to complete the documentation. If you want to be an early adopter of this theme, you might have to read the source. Multiple authors If an article has multiple authors, specify their names in an array in the author field. Author’s bio is loaded from the database data/authors.yaml. Table of contents TOC can be automatically generated, no matter if you use Hugo/goldmark or Pandoc/R Markdown. Number sections Section headers can be automatically numbered, no matter if you use Hugo/goldmark or Pandoc/R Markdown. Footnotes, citations, and sidenotes Footnotes and citation entries4 are moved to the right margin by default. If you want to write arbitrary sidenotes, use the classes side and side-left/side-right. This is a sidenote on the left side. You can include anything in the note. For example, here is a bullet list: Get up Do the work Go to bed Content to be displayed as a sidenote.  Appendix Author’s bio Custom fields License Suggest changes Drafts Mark an article as draft by adding draft: true to the YAML metadata. Draft articles are styled with a background of diagonal lines and a watermark “Draft.” For listing pages, draft articles are also indicated by the background. Floats Full-width elements Apply the class fullwidth, e.g., Content to be displayed with its maximum width.  Figure 3.1: Beginning around 301 BC, Zeno taught philosophy at the Stoa Poikile (“Painted Porch”), from which his philosophy got its name. Unlike the other schools of philosophy, such as the Epicureans, Zeno chose to teach his philosophy in a public space, which was a colonnade overlooking the central gathering place of Athens, the Agora. If you want the full-width element to be scrollable, you can apply an additional class fullscroll, e.g., Super wide content to be scrolled horizontally.  Figure 3.2: This painting is known as the “Qing Court Version” of Along the River During the Qingming Festival. Here, the figural scenes are numerous and detailed, happening around noteworthy landmarks and places such as the serene rustic countryside, the Rainbow Bridge (虹橋) and its crowded markets, the lively surroundings and throughways at the city walls and gates, the busy streets and various packed shops, the secluded literati gardens, the Songzhu Hall (松竹軒) as well as the beautiful site of the Jinming Lake (金明池). Embedded elements Use the embed-left or embed-right class to embed a content block to be floated to the left or right, and the block will exceed the article margin by 200px, e.g., Content to be embedded onto the margin.  One application is to embed videos in an article, when the video needs a narrative. For example, you can embed a video on the right side, and provide a narrative in the body of the article, which will be on the left side of the video. By default, the max-width of the embedded element is 600px (the actual width could be smaller), out of which 200px will be in the margin, meaning that there will be at least 400px left for the narrative in the article body. When the screen width is smaller than 1200px, the embedded elements will be floated back into the article as normal block-level elements. Quotes Use the quote-left or quote-right class to make content float to the left or right. A quote to be floated to the left.  The quotes do not have to be literally quotes. These environments can contain any content, although quotes may be the most common application. Here is a quote that I’ve never said. The default width of the content is 45% of the container. You have seen an example of quote-right at the beginning of this article. Here is an example of quote-left on the left side. The quotes will stop floating and become normal block-level elements when the screen width is smaller than 800px.
