# test-site

This is the content and resulting htm files for the Im Lab webpage [hakyimlab link](http://hakyimlab.org)


#
How to edit webpage
- edit content (post, project, talk) [tutorial](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/#posts)
- build static pages (run `hugo server` in the terminal)
- git add/commit/push

#
Reminder to myself from time to time,
- update hugo (> brew upgrade)
- update hugo-academic theme (download https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic and copy to ~/Github/homepage/themes/hugo-academic
)



## todo
need to find better location for images (not covered by template)
for example
`![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hakyimlab/homepage/master/static/img/2017/lab-summer-2017.jpg)`
