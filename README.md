How to edit webpage
- edit content (post, project, talk) [tutorial](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/#posts)
- build static pages (run `hugo server` in the terminal to see locally)
- git add/commit/push
- run deploy.sh from the terminal (hosted in aws s3)

#
Reminder to myself from time to time,
- update hugo (> brew upgrade)
- update hugo-academic theme (download https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic and copy to ~/Github/homepage/themes/hugo-academic
)
